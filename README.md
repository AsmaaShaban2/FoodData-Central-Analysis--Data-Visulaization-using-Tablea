# Data Analysis and Visualization Project â€“ FoodData Central Dataset  

## Project Overview

This project focuses on exploring and analyzing the FoodData Central dataset, which contains detailed information about the nutritional composition of various food items. The aim is to identify patterns in nutrients, serving sizes, and calorie content across different food types, and to present the findings in a visually compelling way.

The project uses Python for data cleaning and exploration, leveraging libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Visualizations are created using both Python and Tableau, to effectively communicate the nutritional imbalances in branded foods and propose ways to create healthier options for consumers.

## Key Steps & Approach

1. **Data Cleaning:**  
   Used Pandas and NumPy to clean the dataset, handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies in the data.

2. **Data Exploration & Analysis:**  
   Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and trends in food composition, focusing on nutrients, serving sizes, and calorie content.

3. **Data Visualization:**  
   Created insightful visualizations in Python using Matplotlib and Seaborn, and built an interactive Tableau dashboard to present the findings.

4. **Insights & Findings:**  
   - Analyzed the nutritional imbalances in branded foods.
   - Highlighted foods with high calorie and low nutrient content.
   - Proposed potential healthier food options based on analysis.
